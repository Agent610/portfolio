      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I’m a Software Engineer who brings a disciplined, professional mindset
        influenced by preparing for a highly structured law enforcement career
        and by my respect for the standards upheld by the Connecticut State
        Police. That process reinforced the importance of accountability,
        attention to detail, and professionalism — qualities I carry into my
        work as an engineer. I specialize in full-stack development with a
        strong focus on backend systems, authentication, and secure application
        design, while also contributing to responsive and accessible frontends.
        I build scalable web applications using JavaScript, React, Node.js,
        Express, and MongoDB, and I’m seeking roles as a Full-Stack Developer or
        Software Engineer where I can deliver secure, maintainable,
        production-ready solutions.
      </p>

        With the people I call my sisters — a reminder that trust, teamwork, and
        support are essential both in life and in engineering teams.
