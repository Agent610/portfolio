        <h2>What To Wear (WTWR) | Full Stack</h2>
        <img src="images/What to Wear.png" alt="What to wear Screenshot" />
        <p>
          (TripleTen) This project is my first full stack application it shows
          the user based off where they are located what clothing is recommended
          based off the weather for example if it's hot wear a t-shirt

        <p>

          application. It serves as a site where users can save their favorite

        <h2>News Explorer | Front End</h2>
        <img src="images/News Explorer.png" alt="News Explorer Screenshot" />
        <p>
          (TripleTen) This is actually my final project from when I was a
          student with TripleTen. This application serves it's purpose by
          showing users news articles that they search also when they are logged
          in they can save stories, this project although it's frontend only
          it's my first fully responsive application, which means it has media
          queries for mobile, tablet and desktop.

        <h2>AroundTheUs | Front End</h2>
        <img src="images/Around The Us.png" alt="Around the Us Screenshot" />
        <p>
          (TripleTen) This application is all about the user being able to save
          where they go around the world. The nice thing about this application
          is that it's a complete view application you don't have to log in or
          create an account. While I was a student at TripleTen this project
          introduced me to APIs (Application Programming Interface)
